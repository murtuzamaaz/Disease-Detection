# SoulScan: Advanced Disease Diagnosis using ML & AI

This platform predicts various diseases, including Heart Disease, Kidney Disease, Diabetes, Liver Disease, Stroke, and also includes an AI-powered assistant. It uses machine learning algorithms trained on medical data to deliver accurate predictions â€” achieving over **90% accuracy**.

## ðŸ”¬ Features

- âœ… **Heart Disease**: Risk assessment based on health parameters.
- âœ… **Kidney Disease**: Predicts chronic kidney disease.
- âœ… **Diabetes**: Estimates diabetes onset probability.
- âœ… **Liver Disease**: Analyzes liver health using test results.
- âœ… **Stroke**: Determines risk of stroke.
- ðŸ¤– **AI Assistant**: Provides personalized recommendations.
- ðŸ“„ **Upload Reports**: Analyze uploaded medical reports.

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/murtuzamaaz/Disease-Detection.git
cd Disease-Detection

python -m venv venv
# Activate:
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```
## How It Works

- The app uses **machine learning** models trained on large datasets to predict disease risk.
- The algorithms analyze user inputs, such as age, gender, medical test results, and lifestyle factors, to generate predictions.
- The system provides personalized recommendations based on the analysis, which could include further medical tests, lifestyle changes, or other suggestions.
